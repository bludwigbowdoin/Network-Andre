This file operates as both the "main" executer of the functions from other 
files as well as the Streamlit builder. Many of the lines in this file are 
rather trivial st.write statements, and I moved as many as I could into helper 
functions, but some would not behave unless written explicitly in the code. 
There are many lines to this file, but the majority of the algorithm based 
thinking is done in the other 3 .py files. 

To execute this file, type 'streamlit run mainSL.py' into the command line 
while in the Poetry-Slam directory.
