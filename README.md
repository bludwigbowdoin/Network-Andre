# Network Andre 


### Description of work:


### How to set up and run the code:

To run the code after cloning the repository, the mini.h5 file that contains 
the word embedding dataset (too large to push to GitHub) must be downloaded 
from this [page](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch). The 
download link is [here](http://conceptnet.s3.amazonaws.com/precomputed-data/2016/numberbatch/19.08/mini.h5)

Once mini.h5 is downloaded and in the directory, go to terminal and enter 
'streamlit run mainSL.py'. Depending on what packages and libraries you do and 
do not have installed, you might have to wait a while and/or enter the 
respective commands to download all libraries and packages. Large models are 
used for spaCy and GPT-2, so these might take a while to download. Just hold 
tight. Eventually, your default browser should open with a blank white 
Streamlit page with 'running' buffering in the top right. This will take up to 
a minute to load, and then an image and text options will appear. The buttons 
and entries are all pretty self-explanatory. For fullest functionality, turn 
on Developer Mode. If speaking mode is turned on, you will have to wait until 
the last output is spoken to try another iteration of Network Andre.
