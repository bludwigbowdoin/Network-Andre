Hey.
So Mike Pence is in the news.

You hear about this?

Apparently, he's married
to a girl.

Yeah.

Uh, maybe he should change
his name to Dyke Pence.

You kiss a girl...
Automatic lesbo, dude.

See you at the leather bar,
hypocrite.

Who's Mike Pence?

I don't know.

I'm having a weekend
at Bernie's.

Dude, what's up?
This is my dead boss.

I got to get him back
to the dean's office

before I get expelled, dude.

His company's goin' pubic.




You guys want to hang
a Dominican CD

from your rearview mirror?

Oh, my God!

This is my homeboy
Right Dude Here.

I'm having a weekend
at Bernie's 2.

Oh, no!

We got to get this corpse back
to Benihana's for happy hour!

Oh! Oh!

Ranch it up!

Ladies and gentlemen,
here from the "Shahs of Sunset,"

La... Uh, Mercedes Javid.

Did I say it right? Hi!

You sure did.

You look beautiful.

As-salamu alaykum.

WWJD?

You look really good.

No.

I want... I want to flip you
around like a Persian crepe...

Oh, my God.

...fly you across
the Atlantic Ocean,

all the way to Tehran,
hit the ayatollah in the face.

He cuts out the eyeholes.

Then he has a Halloween costume

and something to talk about
at parties.

How do you know so much
about the Middle East?

That's my vacation spot.

Who's your favorite
Middle Eastern man?

- Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
- Yeah!

He's not Middle Eastern.

Oh, really?

Oh, my God.

You're sweating your makeup
down your face.

You look insane.
I don't need the makeup.

You look like RuPaul
when he slept outside.

RuPaul?

You're comparing me
to a man right now.

What up, B?

Hey. What's up, Felipe?

Now, you committed
felony bank fraud in 1994.

Yes.
If you could go back
in time,

how would you commit bank fraud
differently?

Sometimes I have sex...

No. But what happened?

Did you get arrested?

No, not really. It was the FBI.

Did you go to jail?

Enh.

For how long?
Like, seriously,
like, barely.

Oh, shit.

If you want tarot cards,
everything is 10% off.

How you doing?

We're doing a special.
Free psychic readings.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Oh, okay.

Have you ever gotten
a, uh, psychic reading before?

I have never,
so this is definitely...

Okay. Okay. Cool.
...an interesting thing.

Well, I'm just a vessel.
The tarot will be our guide.

Hmm.

All right.

Wow. Okay.

Wow.

I'm hearing a voice.
That's for real. Okay.

Somebody's here.
Okay. He's here.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a sign.

I accept it.
This is... Okay.
That's a sign.

He's got advice for you.
He's saying, "Don't..."

Oh, gosh. I can't hear.

"Don't you"...

Whoa.

What?

That's never happened
to me once.

Are you serious? I swear to God.

That's never happened to me
once.
Oh, my God. I've...

Aah! I'm the real psychic!

That guy's holding me hostage!

Why y'all playin' with me
like this?

"Why Y'all Playin' Me
Like This?!?"

Only on CBS.

I ain't got time
for this TV-ass shit, bro.

And we are back
with Mercedes Javid.

Yeah.

Mercedes, you want
some Brett Kavanaugh ale?

No, thank you.

It's like an abortion
in your mouth.

Or in the court.

Roe v. Wave.
You know what I mean?

You want some roe?

It's like a fish abortion
in your mouth.

It's a little insensitive to...

Ahh.

God, that tastes good.

It's disgusting.

- Yeah!

I wish I was Lance Reddick!

I wish I was Lance
mother Reddick!

Um, I dare you to rub his...
His belly.

Mnh-mnh.

Yo.

Mm-hmm.

Bro, where did you

I went to the movies.

Do you normally have no hair
on your body?

You listen to his music?

N... Um, who?

You can tell the truth.

Tell the truth.
About...
If you know me or not.

I mean, what's your name?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Okay.

I like where this is goin'.

Yeah.

- You ever been to Duane Reade?
- I like you.

I like you a lot. Of course.

That's a real New Yorker
right there. Hell yeah.

He's like...

"Oh,
de Blasio canceled the L train."

Oh!

...the Dice Man!

Get a stromboli
and go see the spaghetti sauce.

Oh!

It's my last day being Hasidic.

I'm eating bacon now. Who cares?

It's my last day as a Hasid.
I can do whatever I want.

I'm going to a Christmas party,

hanging out with you so long.

I just came up with that.

Part 2.

If you thought the original

the molecular sequel!

You, Mountain Deux!

We're drinking H2O2!
I'm the king of the world!

God... God is second to me!

You understand?

Okay. Brenda. Yes.

Now, you tweeted recently, "666.
I wish 9/11 happened again."

Why are you trying to be
all things to all people?

I... You know...

You ever been to Seattle? No!

Oh, no! No! No!

The only thing worse than
a human murder is a fish murder.

It is! You know what I mean?

I'm st... I just started...
Like, we have a fish tank...

I'm either killing
or this thing.

You know what I mean? Oh, God.

God.

Careful.

You remember me
from the last time, right?

You're watching "Hostage TV"
in Beverly Hills.

I'm being exploited. It's true.

I can't get away
from these people.

Clam apples.
It's the latest invention.

It's half clam and half apple.

Protein with the clam.
Okay. Yes.

Vitamin C with the apple.

Brother. Brother.
Sign my SARS blanket.

I'm being exploited
by these people.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, you're not.

Yeah, as in I stole the "key to"
the local ice cream parlor.

Yeah, I quit.

You're leaving too?

Clone me.

What?

Aah!

Is that even a cloning machine?

Oh!

Help! Help! Help me! Help.

Can you pedal my penis
out of this thing?

Oy vey.

Ohh!

Oh, I got my penis
caught in the spokes.

I tried to do a cool trick




to impress my wife
before sundown.

Stay where you are.
No, no, no. Don't move.

I'm not actually Hasidic.
I'm Reform.

I'm just wearing this yarmulke

Do you see me tipsy over here?

What's going on?
You drinking?
I'm on my period.

I've got my red wings.
I'm okay with it.

Okay, good.
I got my brown wings.

Oh, my goodness!
That's true.
I read that one.

Hannibal kicked Flavor Flav
in the face,

and Flavor Flav
took it like a little bitch.

I saw that.

It was one of
the funniest pranks.

You thought that was funny?
I felt so bad for him.

Flavor Flav in particular,

I really wanted to get
more insight.

When you first laid eyes on him,
like, how did that...

He's a black mother.

So was it nighttime?
Was it daytime?

Hey, Roy Choi is here.

Why are we having guests?
What is he doing?

He's a celebrity chef.

Ohh! I'm cooking.

What are you cooking?

Crystal meth and placenta.

Do you do coke?
Have you ever done coke?

I've done coke. You're the HBIC.

What they saying?
The head butthole in charge.

No, don't start being nasty.

I'm not flipping you
high-five on that shit.

Come on.
That was a good one, dude.

No, it's not.
You just
totally fell for it.

I have to say, I was very
intimidated to come out here.

Why? And I'm never intimidated.

But y'all got me feeling
like a punk-ass bitch.

Just three people
having a conversation.

You sure? I'm positive.

All right. Aah! Oh!

See, I don't like shit
like that.

Nah, there's dead birds.

Please don't start with me.

No, dead birds.

What else is coming down?

It's just dead birds.
Raining dead birds.

Aah! Oh, God.
Please! Stop, y'all.

Are these birds real?

They're real. Okay.

Oh, shit!

Aah!

Aah! No! No!

What the just happened?

That coffee mug is broken.

I can't take this.

This is going to mess up
my equilibrium.

Help!

Help me!

I got pushed out of a boat.

I got hooked up
with some bad guys.

You lucky to be living.

Take a seat right here
for a minute, bro.

Just chill out, man.
Gather yourself, brother.

Tony Pizza, I think his name is.

Hey, what's going on, man?

How you doing, man?
I'm doing good, brother.

What you working on over here?

I don't know,
the guy got me doing...

Hey, hey, hey.
Some shit just happened.

Homeboy just came out
the mother water.

Got bricks on his feet.

Somebody beat him up and
threw him in the water, my boy.

Are you serious? I've been
looking for a guy like that.

He look like this? Huh?

Oh, you in the mob or something?

No.

You look mobbed up.
You think so?

Yeah, you looking good, boy.

Listen. Seriously.
Want some extra money?

Tell me where he is?

A little extra money?
Nah, brother.

I'll make you a little deal.

$20 off two large pizzas.

Nah, nah.
I'm straight, brother man.
You know what I mean?

If you see him,
I'm going to be over there.

You holler.
Nah, nah.
It's all good, brother.

What the going on right now?

Pfff!
Nigga, this some crazy shit.

I got to get the
up out of here, son.

Psst.

Yo, homes.

Yo, get the out of here, guy.

Dude, you're the man, man.

Yo, homes, don't come over here.

Leave me me the alone, bro.

You've got to get me
a job here with you, man.

Nah, nah. We ain't in this shit
together, bro.

I don't
know you from nowhere, man

You want a shrimp?

Bro...

I've been swimming
with the fishes.
That's what's up.

You should have stayed
in that shit.

You're asking me questions.
I'm just trying to explain.

I'm not asking you shit.

I don't give a if they chop

your mother head off

and throw that shit
in the water...

What? Whose side are you on?

...and send that shit
to your moms, boy.

Okay, man. I'm just...

I'm gonna get on my scooter
and get out of here.

I don't give a
about that scooter.

I'll toss that shit
in the water, too.

It's powered by electric eels.

Eat your heart out, Elon Musk.
I'm out of here.

Yo, what the
is going on right now?

I feel like me and you have,
like,

a chemistry
that can't be denied.

It can be denied because
this is the worst time

I've ever had in an interview.

I feel so uncomfortable. Really?

I can't tell if you're messing
with me or not.

I'm not messing with you!

This is terrible!

I'm getting ready to pack my
things and just get out of here.

We're not even
at the halfway point.

Oh! What the is going...

It's a pelican.

Make it go away!

That's pretty much all it does.

It's a pelican.

What the do y'all have
a pelican in here for?

It's his birthday.

Ha ha!
And we're back with New York.

So, uh,
do you know that smoking...

...is actually good for you?

Oh! Oh!

My titties are gonna come out.
Please don't.

Hey, hey. Leave the medical
mumbo-jumbo for the scientists.

Tiffany. Tiffany.

What's he doing up there?

What happened?

Everything's safe now.

You like those
Spider-Man movies, the new ones?

I do.

Endgame"...

What the is that?

Oh, sorry.
Sorry, he's a little bit drunk.

They kicked me out of the NYPD.

Well, they're trying to.

I'm just getting lit
with this horse.

Hey!

I feel like
I'm in "Paree," France.

Ow!

I gave him a little wine,

so he's like, "Uhh..."

it's good for their heart.

You ever heard of Merlot?

Oh, you're...

I've been getting high as shit
with this thing.

I got the horse high.
Look at him.

Oh! Snack time.

It's a German horse chocolate.

I took this from behind
the horse's tail.

- Isn't that crazy?
- I'm nuts.

I'm eating this horse's feces
right now.

I'm just a cop eating shit
and getting drunk.

Okay. That's what I'm doing.

To put it in other terms
that you could understand,

it's poop from a horse.

Oh, I got you. Yeah.

I got you the first time
you said it.

What the?

"Shit-Eating Horse Cop"

is filmed in front
of a live studio audience.

Is this blood?

You want to introduce
Naya Rivera?

Oh. Naya Rivera.

Naya Rivera!

Hi.

I want to talk to
the real Naya Rivera

and peel back the layers

like a Bloomin' Onion
at the Outback Steakhouse.

What do you want to know?

Do you act or something?

Where'd you get your start?
Jesus Christ.

Can you tell me a story
about your experience on "Glee"?

It was really fun.

Were you full of glee
when you went on set?

Hey, you want some moth water?

What? No.

Check it out. It's moth water.

No. No. It's been sitting

outside Keto's house
for like seven years.

Do you want some?
No. No, absolutely
the not.

Are you sure? No.

Why? I'm not gonna
pour it on you.

No, no, no, no.
Want to drink it?

No!
No, no, we're not gonna
pour it on you. It's moth water.

You don't know the healing
powers of moth water.

Ooh, that's nice.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Big Freedia!

Lil Freedia!

Oh!

All right, Lil Freedia.

- These birds real?
- They're real.

Okay.
